            Emergency Medicine (University Hospital) - 5.5 blocks
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            Second-year residents become more well-rounded, efficient, and
            complete in their work-up of patients. Often during this year,
            residents work one-on-one with an attending on the "low side"
            managing upwards of 10-15 patients at a time. By the end of second
            year, residents feel confident in their multi-tasking ability and
            are able to manage most patients on the non-trauma side
            independently (with attending supervision). Furthermore, residents
            are now expected to take presentations from medical students, and
            learn to balance clinical and teaching responsibilities with regard
            to students. Pediatric ED and Fast Track shifts continue to be
            scattered throughout each ED block.
          </p>

            Emergency Medicine (East Orange VA Hospital) - 1 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            This rotation affords the second-year resident an opportunity to
            hone clinical skills in a smaller, community-based ED setting with
            one-on-one support from an attending physician. This experience also
            adds in some Fast Track experience so that residents become
            comfortable with bread-and-butter/basic EM pathology.
          </p>

            Pediatric Emergency Medicine - 1 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph u-margin-bottom-medium">
            This rotation is divided into two 2-week blocks, ideally one in
            warmer months and one in colder months so that residents gain
            exposure to the seasonal variation in pediatric pathology. The
            rotation is based at University Hospital's Pediatric ED, with
            primary supervision of residents provided by Pediatric EM-trained
            faculty.
          </p>

            ED Administration/QA-QI & Observation Medicine - 1 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            This rotation provides exposure to principles of ED administration,
            including managing patient flow, throughput, physician scheduling,
            research management, and collaboration with other departments and
            institutional leadership. During their Observation Medicine shifts
            residents are exposed to an EM-managed protocol-driven observation
            unit. They further develop clinical skills in assessment, treatment
            and discharge planning, while learning to oordinate care plans with
            other physician and healthcare providers. Finally, the rotation
            affords residents time to develop and conduct an individual quality
            assurance/quality improvement (QA/QI) project - over the past few
            years 100% of these projects have been accepted as abstracts to the
            annual SAEM meeting.

            Social Determinants of Health/Community & Urban Health - 0.5 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            Newark is a significantly underserved area with significant
            socio-economic challenges. To be effective in the care of our ED
            patients we need to understand them and the resources available (or
            not available) to them. This novel rotation is designed to expose
            residents to the circumstances in which our patients reside and seek
            healthcare. Residents will work with an inter-disciplinary team
            including students (health-related professions, medicine, nursing
            and public health), nurses, nurse practitioners and community health
            workers, with supervision from EM faculty involved in
            Community/Urban Health. Residents will be introduced to the complex
            problems of health care delivery to marginalized and underserved
            populations, along with affording them an opportunity to improve
            their skills in cultural competency, community empowerment and
            interdisciplinary communication. The rotation will take place at the
            Jordan and Harris Community Health Center, three housing
            developments (Terrell, Hawkins and Riverview), as well as via a
            mobile medical van.

            Obstetrics & Gynecology - 0.5 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph u-margin-bottom-small">
            This block is focused on Labor & Delivery and residents gain comfort
            with the assessment and management of patients beyond 20 weeks in
            their pregnancy.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            During this rotation on the Labor & Delivery Unit of UH, residents
            are exposed to a variety of common Ob/Gyn emergencies and perform
            supervised vaginal deliveries in a controlled setting.
          </p>

            SICU - 1 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            The Surgical Intensive Care Unit is often an extension of the trauma
            bay at University Hospital. As a result, these are often the sickest
            patients in the hospital. This is also an opportunity to manage
            high-risk and complicated post-operative patients. While on this
            service, residents further learn to manage ventilators, are exposed
            to tracheostomy placement, manage and place chest tubes, and manage
            and place central lines. The team consists of surgical residents, EM
            residents from other institutions, trauma fellows, and trauma
            attendings.
          </p>

            NICU - 1 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            During the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit rotation, residents are part
            of a team managing critically ill neonates in the hospital. They
            perform neonatal resuscitations during high-risk obstetric
            deliveries, often being the senior resident on the team. After the
            deliverys, many of these patients are on ventilators and multiple
            medication infusions. This population also allows a focused
            environment for performing procedures on pediatric patients
            including intubation, chest tube insertion, and lumbar puncture.
          </p>

            Elective - 0.5 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            This block is designed to allow residents to explore their clinical,
            scholarly and/or research interests whether related to future
            career/fellowship plans or purely their clinical interests. By
            affording them elective time early in residency it allows residents
            to "try" experiences they may not otherwise consider.
