          On behalf of the residents, faculty and staff, welcome to our
          residency program in Emergency Medicine at Rutgers Health/New Jersey
          Medical School in Newark, New Jersey! We'd encourage you to review our
          website in detail so that you can learn more about us and what we have
          to offer.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph pd-greeting__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          First, some history about our institution.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph pd-greeting__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          The city of Newark developed the City Hospital in 1882 to care for its
          sick and indigent population. Over the years, the hospital experienced
          several transformations and moved several times adjusting to its
          growing needs, with the current University Hospital being completed in
          1958. In 1970, the state government established the College of
          Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey on its current campus, which was
          awarded university status in 1981. Most recently, in 2013, UMDNJ was
          transitioned to Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey and our
          primary clinical affiliate, University Hospital, became an
          independent, standalone medical center. In July 2020 all residency
          programs under Rutgers and the RWJ Barnabas health system came under a
          common sponsoring institution - Rutgers Health. University Hospital is
          now the principal teaching hospital of Rutgers Health/NJMS, home to a
          Level 1 Trauma Center, and a regional resource for specialized
          services and critical care.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph pd-greeting__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          The city of Newark defines our institution and at its core our goal is
          to provide service to an underserved population. With nearly half a
          million people from a diverse set of racial, ethnic and socioeconomic
          backgrounds we are able provide our residents with a variety of
          experiences. Our residents spend most of their time at University
          Hospital where we care for patients mainly from an urban environment,
          but being a tertiary care referral center also from the surrounding
          region.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph pd-greeting__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          This location also highlights our role as an urban public hospital. As
          recent events have raised to the forefront issues related to racial
          injustice, growing economic inequality and the direct impact on our
          patient's well-being, we are of the mindset that these are not "new"
          issues - we have recognized these issues for years and arguably it is
          advocacy for changing the status quo with regard to these issues that
          bring us to this institution.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph pd-greeting__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          Our location additionally challenges us with a large amount of
          penetrating trauma, blunt trauma from multiple major highways in the
          near vicinity, injuries and exposures from a large nearby industrial
          area, as well as an international airport and seaport that is often a
          window to the medical problems of the world. We feel that this wide
          variety of pathology and critical illnesses provides our residents
          with one of the best clinical experiences in the region – one that is
          both intensive and educational.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph pd-greeting__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          This clinical training is paired with an academic department that has
          education as its major goal. The residency program enrolled its first
          class in 2004, and has been an independent department since 2009. Our
          graduates have gone on to practice emergency medicine in varying
          academic and community settings throughout the country. We also have
          graduates that have pursued competitive fellowships in subspecialties
          including administration, EMS, global health/international EM,
          pediatric emergency medicine, sports medicine, toxicology and
          ultrasound, as well as some that have established themselves in the
          corporate world.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph pd-greeting__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          As a program we are well established with nearing 20 years since our
          founding. However, we remain a dynamic program that is constantly
          evolving to meet the needs of our patients and trainees. For example,
          despite being a program with relatively high procedural volume we have
          also noted a drop nationally in some procedures based on changing
          imaging technology, guidelines and management options (such as lumbar
          punctures). Rather than be content with our procedural volumes we have
          proactively moved to regular procedure training days (every 4 weeks)
          so as to build muscle memory for core and not-so-common procedures.
          Similarly, to address the social distance and loss of community that
          the COVID pandemic created we have initiated regular class days off
          (every 4 weeks) to promote bonding and wellness. These are just some
          of the ways that we continue to anticipate challenges and grow to
          address them.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph pd-greeting__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          While excellent clinical and academic training is a hallmark of our
          program, what sets us apart is our commitment to the community we
          serve. The Newark, NJ urban community faces a significant burden of
          not only the medically underserved, but also those with significant
          socioeconomic challenges (25-40% poverty rate, 42% of residents age ≥
          24 have not completed high school, 50% of households do not have
          access to a car, and the highest prevalence of substance use and
          HIV/AIDS in the State of New Jersey). The ED serves as a critical, and
          often only, link to the healthcare system for many patients in Newark.
          Therefore, we place a priority on educating our residents in the
          social determinants of health and recognizing that the best
          patient-centered, emergency care includes exploring a patient’s
          culture, social context, and determinants surrounding their visit and
          impacting their health.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph pd-greeting__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          Finally, in addition to our mission to provide excellent clinical and
          research training we place a priority on resident well-being and
          diversity. We firmly believe that to be effective in our intense
          clinical environment it is imperative that our residents be well
          rested, balanced and simply put...happy! Our goal is not just to train
          you to be an excellent emergency physicians, but to provide you with
          the tools to be an effective and productive individual at home, in
          your community and at work. We are proud of the camaraderie that
          exists in our residency and that all our residents feel part of a
          family. Please refer to our page on diversity to see how we strive to
          train a diverse workforce that can support our diverse patient
          population.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph pd-greeting__text u-margin-bottom-large">
          We invite you to learn more about our program via this website and
          feel free to contact us if you require further information. We look
          forward to meeting whether it is on a student rotation with us, or as
          you interview with us to determine if we are the right fit for you.
