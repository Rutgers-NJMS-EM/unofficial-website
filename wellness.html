          Wellness & Support

        <p class="paragraph wellness__text u-margin-bottom-large">
          <strong>
            It is our firm belief that personal wellness is paramount for a good
            residency experience. This not only means conducting wellness
            activities, but also helping to build an infrastructure that
            provides support to residents.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <h5 class="medium-title wellness__subheading u-margin-bottom-small">
          Mentorship & Advising
        </h5>
        <p class="paragraph wellness__text u-margin-bottom-large">
          We believe in differentiating Advising from Mentorship. Each resident
          is assigned an advisor when they begin residency - this is a member of
          the faculty who may or may not share interests with the resident, but
          is intended to be an academic and clinical resource for the resident.
          However, we recognize that these pairings made early in one's
          residency may not be perfect and resident interests evolve. Therefore,
          as a resident gets to know the entire faculty better and develops
          their own interests we promote the formation of mentor-mentee
          relationships that are based on personal compatibility and
          professional interests. Since we have faculty with a large variety of
          interests and sub-specialization are are almost always able to support
          residents' need for mentorship.
        </p>

        <h5 class="medium-title wellness__subheading u-margin-bottom-small">
          Residency Houses
        </h5>
        <p class="paragraph wellness__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          Over the years we have realized that promoting individual
          resident-faculty interactions can be challenging from a scheduling
          standpoint. Also, there may be topics that the faculty may not relate
          to as well as colleagues. This is why in 2019 we developed a system of
          "Residency Families" and "Siblings", and evolved this further into
          Residency "Houses" that are not only meant to be supportive, but are
          also "competitive".
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph wellness__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          This system places incoming residents in a family that includes
          multiple members of the faculty and residents of varying levels. In
          addition incoming residents are assigned one or more "big siblings" in
          the residency. The idea is to have a mixture of faculty with different
          niches. The House overall will participate in the yearly House
          competition to help foster relationships so that residents may be
          provided with lateral mentorship (and compete for a prize).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph wellness__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          Ideally this will allow residents to have a closer relationship with
          faculty of different niches who they may approach and identify as
          different mentors (i.e. to build a board of mentors). Our hope is that
          these systems allow for residents to not only gain advice, but also be
          able to share experiences, commisserate and know that they are not
          alone in what they are experiencing and feeling.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph wellness__text u-margin-bottom-small">
          House Expectations include:
        </p>
        <ul class="small-paragraph wellness__list u-margin-bottom-large">
          <li class="wellness__list--item">
            Participate in communication as a group (group chat, email chain,
            Teams channel, etc.)
          </li>
          <li class="wellness__list--item">
            Participate and help plan organized activities as a group (dinners,
            game nights, etc.)
          </li>
          <li class="wellness__list--item">
            Participate in residency activities and events (conference, retreat,
            wilderness hike, welcome BBQ, etc.)
          </li>
          <li class="wellness__list--item">
            Points make be taken from the House for professional issues (late
            arrival to conference, late completion of paperwork, etc.)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="medium-title wellness__subheading u-margin-bottom-small">
          Wellness Activities
        </h5>
        <p class="paragraph wellness__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          We host in-conference events such as quarterly Wellness sessions,
          monthly "shout-outs", quarterly Financial Wellness sessions, birthday
          celebrations, holiday celebrations (including donation drives for
          hats/gloves/etc. to benefit our local community) and
          resident-leadership meetings.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph wellness__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          Outside the hospital we host a monthly evening Journal Club at an
          attending's house, a Book Club, and staff the NJ Marathon, in addition
          to other social activities that have a focus such as bringing together
          women-in-EM, dinners supporting DEI in the department, and not to
          mention cheering local (or distant) sports teams.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph wellness__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          The residency hosts a yearly, off-site Residency Retreat - all
          residents are protected to attend from 7pm the night before to 7am the
          day after regardless of rotation.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph wellness__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          All EM-4 residents are also given protected time to attend the annual
          ACEP Scientific Assembly and all EM-2 residents are protected to
          attend the annual SAEM Annual Conference. Residents are also usually
          given time and are funded to go to conferences they are presenting at
          or have publications accepted at.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph wellness__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          Finally, we conduct regular conversations regarding mental health and
          well-being in conference including sharing resources such as those
          offered through the institution such as the Resident Wellness and
          Excellence Center.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph wellness__text u-margin-bottom-medium">
          While the current COVID-19 pandemic has altered how we interact and
          presents unforseen challenges, we have tried to engage with residents
          virtually and in-person regarding the impact of COVID, the
          social/economic/political upheaval around us as well as how to
          generally feel connected. We were lucky to be able to conduct our
          annual retreat in an appropriately distanced outdoor venue (Liberty
          State Park) this past year too.
