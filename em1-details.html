            Introduction to Emergency Medicine - 1 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            All incoming first-year residents begin their residency in July in
            the Emergency Department (ED) at University Hospital (UH). There is
            extra resident coverage in the ED during this month to allow an
            easier transition for first-year residents. The number of shifts
            worked are reduced to make room for an integrated EM Boot Camp which
            teaches basic core concepts in Emergency Medicine through lecture,
            small group sessions, skills workshops and simulation exercises.
          </p>

            Emergency Medicine (University Hospital) - 4 blocks
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            As a first-year resident, time spent in the ED is geared toward
            establishing a foundation of Emergency Medicine’s core concepts. The
            primary goals are to learn how to work up the basic chief complaints
            seen in the ED and learn to differentiate between the “sick” and
            “not sick” patient. Firstyear residents are encouraged and expected
            from day one to perform any and all procedures in the department
            including intubation, chest tube insertion, central line insertion,
            lumbar puncture, and laceration repair. These procedures are
            supervised by a senior resident or attending. Approximately 1-2
            shifts during each block are spent in the Pediatric ED at UH, giving
            residents exposure to the variety of pediatric pathology spread
            across the calendar year. Residents will also spend approximately
            1-2 shifts/block in the Fast Track area of the ED beginning August
            2017.

            Emergency Medicine (East Orange VA Hospital) - 1 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            This rotation affords the first-year resident an opportunity to
            learn and practice the basics of emergeny medicine in a smaller,
            community-based ED setting with one-on-one supervision from an
            attending physician. This experience also adds in some Fast Track
            experience so that residents become comfortable with
            bread-and-butter/basic EM pathology.

            Pediatric Emergency Medicine - 1 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            This rotation is divided into two 2-week blocks, ideally one in
            warmer months and one in colder months so that residents gain
            exposure to the seasonal variation in pediatric pathology. The
            rotation is based at University Hospital's Pediatric ED, with
            primary supervision of residents provided by Pediatric EM-trained
            faculty.
          </p>

            Ultrasound - 0.5 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            Utilization of ultrasound in EM continues to grow and it is a core
            tool in our ED. During this dedicated two-week rotation, first-year
            residents learn how to use the ultrasound machine at a basic level
            on patients in the department - the physics of ultrasound,
            “knobology”, how to best capture and save images, etc. Upon
            completion residents are expected to have competence in using the
            ultrasound for procedures, along with exposure to key emergency
            studies. The first-year resident is paired with a senior resident
            for the rotation, and is overseen by our ultrasound faculty.

            Emergency Medical Services (EMS) - 0.5 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            One week of this block is spent on the ground doing shifts alongside
            paramedics and EMTs in the ambulance as they evaluate and transport
            patients around Newark to various hospitals in the area. The other
            week is spent with NorthSTAR (Shock-Trauma Air Rescue). Flying on
            the helicopter for medical evacuations with flight nurses and
            paramedics is an optional experience.

            Anesthesia (AM)/Procedures (PM) - 0.5 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph u-margin-bottom-small">
            This block combines Anesthesiology in the morning along with
            Procedures in the afternoon. The Anesthesiology rotation provides
            first-year residents the opportunity to learn to manage the airway
            in a controlled Operating Room setting using a variety of modalities
            - BVM ventilation, direct and video-assisted laryngoscopy, LMA,
            etc..
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            While on the Procedures rotation residents focus on ED-based
            procedures while also working alongside a variety of consultants in
            learning procedural skills relevant to the acute management of ED
            patients. While on this rotation the resident fields consults from
            the ED related to a variety of specialties such as Orthopedic
            Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Ophthalmology, Otolaryngology, etc.. The
            resident works as a liaison and partner with the consulting service
            while learning and performing key procedures including fracture
            reductions, complex laceration repair and ophthalmologic procedures.

            MICU - 1 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            While on the Medical Intensive Care Unit, first-year residents serve
            a primary role as part of the critical care team. The team is
            composed of ICU attendings, fellows, residents from multiple
            specialties and medical students. This rotation is a great setting
            to manage the sickest patients over their disease course. By the end
            of this rotation, first-year residents are comfortable treating
            conditions such as DKA, severe sepsis/septic shock, massive GI
            bleeding, and strokes. They also gain competence in placing central
            lines, managing a ventilator, and selecting/dosing vasopressors.

          <p class="paragraph">
            While on the Coronary Care Unit, first-year residents serve a
            primary role as part of the Cardiology critical care team. The team
            is composed of Cardiology attendings, fellows, Internal Medicine
            residents, and medical students. This rotation particularly exposes
            residents to the management of very common, but life-threatening
            cardiac conditions such as congestive heart failure, myocardial
            infarction, and heart block. This allows for focused exposure to
            echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, pericardial windows, and
            pacemakers, among other things.

            Trauma - 1 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            As northern New Jersey’s only level-1 trauma center, UH is a prime
            location for great trauma exposure including high speed motor
            vehicle accidents, falls from high elevation, burns, stab wounds,
            and gunshot wounds. Almost one-third of trauma activations are for
            penetrating injuries (significantly higher than comparable national
            trauma centers) and our Injury Severity Score for trauma activations
            is higher than our peer group of trauma centers. This dedicated
            rotation allows first-year residents to be part of the Trauma Team
            that responds to Priority 1 and 2 trauma activations in the ED, and
            care for the inpatient service. The team is composed of attending
            physicians, fellows, residents from various specialties, nurse
            practitioners and medical students. First-year residents perform
            primary and secondary surveys, FAST ultrasound examinations, and
            place chest tubes and central lines. Resuscitative thoracotomies are
            frequently performed in the ED Trauma-Shock Room. Trauma is also
            integrated within EM blocks during EM-3 and EM-4 years.

            Addiction Medicine & Emergency Psychiatry - 0.5 block
          </h4>

          <p class="paragraph">
            During this rotation residents will work faculty and residents from
            the Department of Psychiatry in the psychiatric section of the
            Emergency Department. Residents will gain skills related to the
            evaluation of patients presenting with acute psychiatric conditions,
            psychiatric clearance and management of substance-induced
            psychiatric disorders. Residents will also spend two half-days in
            the Addiction Medicine clinic with faculty from both the Department
            of Emergency Medicine and the Department of Psychiatry as they
            evaluate and manage patients with a variety of addictions and
            substance abuse. This rotation allows residents to work directly
            with renowned experts in the field and participate in grant-funded
            research projects, while directly impacting our patients given the
            high rate of substance abuse and addiction in the Newark area.
